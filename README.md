## 📁 Repository Notice

This repository contains **only the core C# script files** used in the development of the GAIA PROTOCOL project.

Due to platform limitations, the **complete Unity project including assets, scenes, models, and build files** could not be uploaded. The full project contains large 3D models, textures, animations, and other asset files that significantly exceed repository size constraints.

## 📂 Included

- `ChoiceSequenceManager.cs` – Controls ordered user choices and consequences in puzzles  
- `CrossUniverse.cs` – Handles transitions between different themed worlds/zones  
- `CrossHome.cs` – Manages logic specific to returning to the main hub (living room) 
- `CrossPlatformSceneLoader.cs` – Detects platform and loads appropriate build (WebGL/VR)  
- `SlideDrop.cs` – Enables puzzle interactions like placing or sliding objects  
- `Teleporter.cs` – Manages player teleportation mechanics between room zones  
- `ObjectCollision.cs` – Triggers events upon collision with interactive objects  
- `ObjectDisappearance.cs` – Controls visibility or removal of objects upon interaction  
- `PlatformSwitcher.cs` – Adapts controls/UI for Meta Quest or WebGL platforms
- Other helper scripts for interaction, animation triggers, and environmental feedback
